A simple command line application, which does the following:
Add course offering
Register for the course
Cancel registration
Course allotment

Entities:
1. Course
2. Employee
3. Registration

Design Patterns Used:
1. Factory Method Pattern - For creating and handling commands
2. Command Pattern - For creating commands like - Add course command, Register command, Allot command and Cancel registration command
3. Facade Pattern - CourseSchedulingManager is implemented using Facade pattern

Scope Of improvement:
We can add a task in the Application which will iterate through all the courses and set them as cancelled
if the date is past the date of the course start date. We would not accept registrations for these courses.
This task can be a cron job that runs periodically or can be invoked via some command.
